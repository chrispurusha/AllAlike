# tiVoices.c - the voices

## 1. A placeholder voice
Oscillator, filter and a gate envelope (2 ms attack, 120 ms release), per voice, until the engine's own sections -
envelopes, the amplifier, modulation - replace them one by one.

## 2. The voice limit
The instance's voice limit (design §1), 1 to 32. A note takes the voice already playing its key, else a free
voice, else the oldest. Lowering the limit releases the voices above it rather than cutting them.

## 3. The sound
`tTiSound` is the patch as the voices play it, in the panel's units; the plug-in builds it from its parameters each
block. A loaded Single will fill the same struct.

## 4. Filter coefficients every 32 samples
The filter's coefficients are worked out every 32 samples and shared by every voice: nothing per voice moves the
cutoff yet. Every 32 rather than once a host block so that a glide (§5) is not stepped by a host's block size, which
can be 1024 samples. Keyfollow and the filter envelope will make them per voice.

## 5. Smoothing a control change
The reference glides a changed Cutoff or Resonance to its new value in a straight line over a fixed time, whatever
the size of the change: 2048 samples at 46875 Hz, 43.7 ms (measured on the Init Single, whose Parameter Smooth Mode
is On, against Off, where the change is immediate - findings.md). Here both glide that way; a new value starts a new
glide from wherever the last one had got to. The other Smooth modes (Auto, Note, the quantised ones) are not built.
